This is an experimental engine / interpreter as a spin off of my synthetic
architecture work (the syn project). The problem with the syn project is that
it generates code as part of its build process which makes it difficult to
construct a scummvm backend with it. 

Instead of trying to break either my code or scummvm's code to make one fit
into the other, I've decided to write an engine/interpreter entirely within
scummvm.
